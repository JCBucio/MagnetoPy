# Overview

MagnetoPy is an open-source Command Line Interface (CLI) written in Python, designed to process magnetic data. With a robust set of commands, MagnetoPy aims to simplify the analysis and manipulation of magnetic data for geophysicists in the field.

## Features

- **Diurnal variation correction**: MagnetoPy command that calculate the diurnal variation using field and base station data.

- **IGRF correction**: MagnetoPy command that calculate the total magnetic field intensity from the IGRF coefficients using field data and base stations.

- **Reduction to the Pole (RTP)**: MagnetoPy command that compute the reduction to the pole of magnetic data using frequency domain calculations through Fast Fourier Transform.

## Installation

Check the ENVIROMENT_MANUAL.md file in the `docs` folder to prepare your environment.

## Usage

Check the HOW_TO_USE.md file in the `docs` folder to learn how to use the CLI.
